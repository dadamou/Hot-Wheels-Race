Instead, the size difference is reflected in their stats, so there is no need to worry about the bulkier-looking cars having a weighted benefit or hindrance on the jumps throughout each track. Winning more races will depend on the player's control of each car, which is impacted by the stats. Legendary cars like the Batmobile have the best stats.",

        "guide": "<p>By far the two most important stats to worry about in Hot Wheels Unleashed are Acceleration and Handling. Acceleration determines how quickly a car reaches its top speed, while Handling affects how well a car can take turns. A quick tap of the &quot;brake button&quot; is all that&apos;s needed to begin drifting around sharp turns, so the Braking Power stat doesn&apos;t need to be higher than three bars to be excellent. Lack of Speed can be compensated by the amount of boost a car has, so if a car has low speed make sure it has a high boost and vice versa.</p>",

Green arrows will indicate a sharp turn, and the blue seals on the track or change in track color are good starting points to begin drifting.</p>",
